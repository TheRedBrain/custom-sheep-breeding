# Custom Sheep Breeding

This mod changes sheep to have a natural color that is set during birth (or when installing this mod). This color can not be changed.

Sheep can still be colored using dye items, but after shearing the color is reset to the natural color again.

Multiple things can be configured in the server config:
- Enable/disable natural colors (if only the other changes are desired).
- The initial colors of spawned sheep (and the chances of the colors).
- The chances for a baby sheep to inherit one of their parents colors.
- The chances for a baby sheep to inherit a blend of their parents colors. This is by default one of the parents colors, but exceptions can be defined.
- The chances for a baby sheep to have a random color (and the chances of the colors).

The default settings allow for gameplay where acquiring sheep in all 16 variations turns into a quest of finding sheep in the wild, breeding the correct colors together and a little luck.

The config provides all values that simulate vanilla behaviour. Note that not all colors can be permanently aquired using those values.

### Important!
As always, make back-ups of your worlds when using mods!

This mod was inspired by the Hardcore Sheep feature of the legendary Better Than Wolves mod.
