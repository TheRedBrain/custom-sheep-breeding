# Custom Sheep Breeding

This mod changes sheep to have a permanent color that is set during birth (or when installing this mod). This color can not be changed.

Sheeps can still be colored using dye items, but after shearing the color is reset to the permanent color again.

Multiple things can be configured:
- The initial colors of spawned sheep (and the chances of the colors).
- The chances for a baby sheep to inherit one of their parents colors.
- The chances for a baby sheep to inherit a blend of their parents colors. This is by default one of the parents colors, but exceptions can be defined.
- The chances for a baby sheep to have a random color (and the chances of the colors).

The default settings allow for gameplay where aquiring sheep in all 16 variations turns into a little quest of finding sheep in the wild, breeding the correct colors together and a little luck.

The config provides all values that simulate vanilla behaviour. Note that not all colors can be permanently aquired using those values.

### Important!
As always, make back-ups of your worlds! The changes made by this mod should be harmless, but I take no responsibility for corrupted data.

This mod was inspired by the Hardcore Sheep feature of the legendary Better Than Wolves mod.
